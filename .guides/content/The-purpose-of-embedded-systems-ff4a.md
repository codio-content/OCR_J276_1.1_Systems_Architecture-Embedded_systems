The purpose of an embedded system is to control the larger device in which it is embedded.

Each embedded system is built for a small range of specific tasks unlike desktop and laptop computers which are general purpose and are capable of carrying out many different tasks.

Embedded systems are described as real-time systems because they must guarantee an immediate response in order for the system to react to different situations. This can be critical when they are controlling braking systems in vehicles.

In an embedded system, resources such as memory are limited and the hardware components are often unique to that system. 
The programs to control them are often written in assembly language rather than a high level language so that the hardware components can be more easily controlled.
