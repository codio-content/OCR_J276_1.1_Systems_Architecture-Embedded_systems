The computer systems are embedded in these devices.
All of the components in an embedded system including 

- processor,
- memory and 
- input and output interfaces which are linked to devices such as switches, dials, heaters and pumps
are on a single printed circuit board (PCB).


The memory contains the program. 
The board is a component built into a larger device, hence the name ‘embedded’.
